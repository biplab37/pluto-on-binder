# How to run Pluto on binder

You can use binder to run notebooks for free on the web.

### Step 1

**Upload your notebook to the web**, and copy the link to your notebook file. An easy way to put notebook files online is using [https://gist.github.com/](https://gist.github.com/)

### Step 2

Go to [https://pluto-on-binder.glitch.me/](https://pluto-on-binder.glitch.me/) and paste your notebook link into the box. This will **generate a binder link** for your notebook that you can share with your friends!

# Note

This is the public repository that gets launched behind the scenes when you use a link generated by [https://pluto-on-binder.glitch.me/](https://pluto-on-binder.glitch.me/).

You probably do **not** want to fork this repository and use it for another project, **these instruction will come soon**. This is also **not** the recommended way to install Pluto as a jupyter extension. For this, we are working on https://github.com/fonsp/pluto-on-jupyterlab.

Reading the source code of this repository might be confusing! But to Pluto's developers: have a look at the different branches, the master branch is for the demo link, all other branches are for other experiments.
